6. Techniques for Sentiment Analysis
There are multiple methods to analyze sentiment from Amazon reviews:

6.1 Text Preprocessing
📌 Steps in Cleaning the Data:

Removing punctuation, special characters, and numbers.
Lowercasing text.
Removing stop words (e.g., "the", "is", "and").
Lemmatization (converting words to their base form, e.g., "running" → "run").
6.2 Sentiment Analysis Models
1️⃣ Machine Learning-Based Models
✅ Naïve Bayes – Simple, effective for text classification.
✅ Support Vector Machines (SVM) – Works well for binary and multi-class sentiment analysis.
✅ Random Forest & Decision Trees – Used to classify reviews into sentiment categories.

2️⃣ Deep Learning-Based Models
✅ LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory Networks) – Suitable for sequential text processing.
✅ BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) – A state-of-the-art NLP model for analyzing sentiment with high accuracy.

6.3 Sentiment Scoring Techniques
Lexicon-Based Approach: Assigns scores based on pre-defined sentiment dictionaries (e.g., VADER, TextBlob).
Word Embeddings: Uses word vectorization (Word2Vec, GloVe) for better context understanding.
7. Implementation Process for Amazon Sentiment Analysis
