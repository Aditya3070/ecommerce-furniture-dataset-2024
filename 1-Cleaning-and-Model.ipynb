# Sample dataset
reviews = ["Great product, very comfortable!", "Worst experience, chair broke.", "Average quality, expected better."]
labels = ["Positive", "Negative", "Neutral"]

# Train a Na√Øve Bayes model
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(reviews)
y = labels
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
model = MultinomialNB()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
print("Model trained successfully!")
```
